# Deployment Readiness Quick Check

## ðŸ”´ **HARD BLOCKERS** (Must fix before deployment)

### Security
- [x] Remove default passwords from code
- [x] Add security validation on startup
- [x] Create security deployment checklist
- [ ] **Database-backed authentication** (currently in-memory)
- [ ] **Secrets in environment/vault** (not in code)

### Reliability  
- [x] Create resilience patterns module
- [ ] **Wire retry/circuit breakers to API clients**
- [ ] **Proper error handling** (not just log and continue)

### Testing
- [x] Migrate tests to pytest framework
- [ ] **Run test suite and ensure >70% coverage**
- [ ] **Add integration tests for external APIs**

## ðŸŸ¡ **SHOULD FIX** (Can deploy then fix)

### Operations
- [ ] Systemd service files
- [ ] Graceful shutdown with drain
- [ ] Backup scripts
- [ ] Log rotation config

### Monitoring
- [ ] Wire up tracing (OTEL already installed)
- [ ] Define SLOs and alerts
- [ ] Add correlation IDs

### Governance  
- [ ] Audit logging for trades
- [ ] Model versioning
- [ ] Data retention policy

## ðŸŸ¢ **NICE TO HAVE** (Future enhancements)

### Intelligence Layer
- [ ] GARCH-LSTM implementation
- [ ] Options pricing models
- [ ] Continuous training pipeline
- [ ] Local LLM integration

### Advanced Features
- [ ] Multi-user support
- [ ] Role-based permissions
- [ ] Advanced risk models
- [ ] Performance optimization

## Deployment Commands

```bash
# 1. Validate security
python -m trading_common.security_validator --environment production

# 2. Run tests
pytest tests/ -v --cov=api --cov=services --cov-report=term-missing

# 3. Check for secrets
grep -r "password\|secret\|key" --include="*.py" . | grep -v ".pyc" | grep -v "test"

# 4. Start with security validation
ENVIRONMENT=production python api/main.py
```

## Post-Deployment Priorities

1. **Week 1**: Database auth, audit logging
2. **Week 2**: Model registry, provenance tracking  
3. **Week 3**: First ML model (volatility)
4. **Month 2**: Advanced models, LLM integration

## Risk Acceptance

By deploying with current state, you accept:
- Single admin user (add multi-user post-deploy)
- No audit trail (add logging post-deploy)
- Basic ML only (enhance models post-deploy)
- Manual backup process (automate post-deploy)

## Sign-off

- [ ] Security review completed
- [ ] Tests passing with adequate coverage
- [ ] Production secrets configured
- [ ] Deployment approved by: _______________
- [ ] Date: _______________
