# Continuous Learning & Model Improvement System

## Overview

The AI Trading System implements a sophisticated continuous learning framework that ensures models improve over time through automated training, performance monitoring, and intelligent optimization - all using **100% local models with zero API costs**.

## Key Components

### 1. **Off-Hours Training Service** (`off_hours_training_service.py`)
- **Automated Scheduling**: Trains models during market closures (nights, weekends, holidays)
- **Resource Management**: Manages concurrent training jobs with resource limits
- **Feature Engineering**: Generates 50+ technical, price action, volume, volatility, momentum, and seasonal features
- **Model Zoo**: Trains Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM, and Gradient Boosting models
- **Performance Tracking**: Comprehensive metrics including Sharpe ratio, directional accuracy, win rate

### 2. **Continuous Improvement Engine** (`continuous_improvement_engine.py`)
- **Performance Analysis**: Real-time tracking of model performance with weakness detection
- **LLM-Powered Optimization**: Uses local Ollama models to analyze and suggest improvements
- **AutoML Experiments**: Automated experimentation with feature engineering, hyperparameter tuning, ensemble methods
- **Deployment Pipeline**: Automatic deployment of improved models that exceed improvement thresholds

### 3. **ML Orchestrator** (`ml_orchestrator.py`)
- **Lifecycle Management**: Tracks models through training → validation → staging → production
- **Health Monitoring**: Continuous health checks for drift, staleness, and performance degradation
- **Adaptive Learning**: Adjusts training frequency based on market regime (volatility, trends)
- **Ensemble Coordination**: Manages multiple models working together

### 4. **Reinforcement Learning Engine** (`reinforcement_learning_engine.py`)
- **Q-Learning**: Deep Q-Network for optimal trading decisions
- **Experience Replay**: Learns from historical trading experiences
- **Online Learning**: Continuously adapts to market changes

## Local Model Configuration
