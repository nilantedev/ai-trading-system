## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Model Unavailable
```json
{"error": {"code": "MODEL_ERROR", "message": "Graph neural network model is currently retraining"}}
```
**Solution**: Wait for retraining to complete (~15 minutes) or use ensemble without GNN.

#### Insufficient Data
```json
{"error": {"code": "INSUFFICIENT_DATA", "message": "Need at least 252 days of data for factor analysis"}}
```
**Solution**: Use shorter lookback periods or wait for more data accumulation.

#### Rate Limiting
```json
{"error": {"code": "RATE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED", "message": "Too many requests"}}
```
**Solution**: Implement request batching or use WebSocket streaming for real-time updates.

### Performance Monitoring

#### Model Health Checks
```bash
# Check model status
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/intelligence/health" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"
```

#### Prediction Accuracy Tracking
- Models automatically track prediction accuracy
- Performance metrics available in system logs
- Automatic retraining triggered when accuracy drops
