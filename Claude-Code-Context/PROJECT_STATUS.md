## 🎯 Development Philosophy

### Incremental Development Strategy
1. **Each phase must be 100% complete** before proceeding
2. **All tests must pass** before phase advancement
3. **Documentation must be updated** with each change
4. **Performance benchmarks** must be validated
5. **Context files must be maintained** for AI development

### Quality Gates
- ✅ **Infrastructure Health**: All services operational
- ✅ **Test Coverage**: 90%+ unit tests, 80%+ integration
- ✅ **Performance**: All latency/throughput targets met
- ✅ **Security**: No critical vulnerabilities
- ✅ **Documentation**: Complete and current
