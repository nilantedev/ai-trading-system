## [Unreleased] - 2024-08-25

### Security Improvements

#### Added
- **Security Validator Module** (`trading_common/security_validator.py`)
  - Comprehensive security configuration validation
  - Environment-specific requirement enforcement
  - Forbidden secrets detection
  - Required environment variable checking
  - Production-specific security gates

- **Security Deployment Checklist** (`SECURITY_DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md`)
  - Pre-deployment security validation steps
  - Critical security gates marked
  - Emergency procedures documentation
  - Credential rotation process

- **Deployment Ready Checklist** (`DEPLOYMENT_READY_CHECKLIST.md`)
  - Categorized blockers vs nice-to-haves
  - Phased deployment approach
  - Risk acceptance documentation

- **Resilience Module** (`trading_common/resilience.py`)
  - Circuit breaker implementation
  - Retry strategy with exponential backoff
  - Rate limiter (token bucket)
  - Bulkhead pattern for resource isolation
  - Decorators for easy integration

#### Changed
- **Authentication System** (`api/auth.py`)
  - Removed default password fallback logic
  - Fixed duplicate `get_optional_user` function
  - Enforces `ADMIN_PASSWORD_HASH` in non-development environments
  - No longer accepts default passwords in production

- **Configuration Validation** (`trading_common/config.py`)
  - Enhanced production security checks
  - Detects and rejects weak/default passwords
  - Strict production environment validation
  - Separates development vs production requirements

- **API Startup** (`api/main.py`)
  - Added security validation on startup
  - Fails fast if security requirements not met
  - Environment-specific security enforcement

- **Rate Limiter** (`api/rate_limiter.py`)
  - Changed to fail-closed in production (no permissive fallback)
  - Development retains in-memory fallback for testing
  - Production denies requests if Redis unavailable

#### Security Fixes
- Removed hardcoded default password "TradingSystem2024!"
- Eliminated duplicate function definitions causing confusion
- Added environment-based security enforcement
- Implemented fail-fast validation for production deployments

### Testing Improvements

#### Added
- **Pytest Test Suite** (`tests/test_services.py`)
  - Migrated from ad-hoc test scripts to proper pytest
  - Added fixtures and proper mocking
  - Async test support
  - Integration test patterns
  - Comprehensive service coverage including:
    - MarketDataService tests
    - NewsService tests
    - DataValidationService tests
    - AlternativeDataCollector tests
    - ReferenceDataService tests
    - Service integration tests

### Documentation

#### Added
- Security deployment checklist with sign-off requirements
- Deployment readiness assessment checklist
- Phased deployment strategy documentation
- Emergency procedures and credential rotation guide

#### Updated
- Added security validation commands to deployment docs
- Documented environment-specific requirements
- Added production gate criteria

### Known Issues / Technical Debt

#### Security
- Authentication still uses in-memory storage (database backing needed)
- No token refresh mechanism implemented
- Audit logging not yet implemented
- Model versioning and governance pending

#### Reliability
- Resilience patterns created but not fully wired to all external API calls
- No automated backup/restore procedures
- Graceful shutdown needs enhancement

#### Testing
- Test coverage below 80% threshold
- Missing performance/load tests
- No security-specific test suite
- Contract tests for external APIs needed

#### ML/Intelligence Layer
- Advanced models (GARCH-LSTM, Options pricing) not implemented
- Model registry and versioning system pending
- Continuous training pipeline not built
- Local LLM integration pending

### Migration Notes

When deploying these changes:

1. **Environment Variables Required**:
   - `ENVIRONMENT` must be set (development/staging/production)
   - `SECURITY_SECRET_KEY` required for non-development
   - `ADMIN_PASSWORD_HASH` required for non-development
   - Remove any `ADMIN_PASSWORD` environment variable in production

2. **Redis Requirement**:
   - Redis is now mandatory for production rate limiting
   - Set `REDIS_PASSWORD` for production Redis instances

3. **Security Validation**:
   - Application will fail to start if security validation fails
   - Run `python -m trading_common.security_validator --environment production` before deployment

4. **Breaking Changes**:
   - Rate limiter no longer falls back to permissive mode in production
   - Default passwords are completely rejected in production
   - JWT secret must be provided via environment (no defaults)

### Deployment Readiness

**Current Status**: Ready for staging/internal testing deployment

**Safe for**:
- Paper trading
- Internal testing
- Single operator use
- Staging environment deployment

**NOT ready for**:
- Multi-user production
- Real capital trading without additional safeguards
- External user access
- Regulatory compliance requirements

### Next Priority Items

1. Implement database-backed authentication
2. Add audit logging for all critical operations
3. Complete resilience pattern integration
4. Achieve 80%+ test coverage
5. Implement basic ML model (beyond prototype)
6. Add backup/restore automation
7. Implement correlation IDs and tracing
