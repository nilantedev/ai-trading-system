## 🔧 TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION

### Backtesting Engine Features

✅ **Realistic Transaction Costs**
- Commission: 10 basis points
- Slippage: Market impact modeling
- Spread crossing simulation

✅ **Multiple Fill Models**
- Instant (unrealistic baseline)
- Aggressive (market orders)
- Passive (limit orders)
- Realistic (combined with partial fills)

✅ **Performance Metrics** (15+)
- Sharpe Ratio (risk-adjusted returns)
- Sortino Ratio (downside risk)
- Calmar Ratio (drawdown-adjusted)
- Maximum Drawdown
- Win Rate, Profit Factor
- Transaction cost analysis

✅ **QuestDB Integration**

### Strategy Adapter Pattern

Created `StrategyAdapter` to provide unified interface:
- Wraps strategies with different method signatures
- Normalizes `generate_signals()`, `generate_signal()`, `generate_quotes()` to `evaluate()`
- Enables all 7 strategies to work with backtesting engine
- Converts numeric signals (-1, 0, 1) to action format (BUY, SELL, HOLD)
